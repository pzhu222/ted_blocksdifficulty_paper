## A note on code

```
If you would like to operate over the raw data, please run the R files under the folder code/cleaning; this will clean the data then read/export these files to the data/clean folder

If you would like to simply reproduce our analyses, run the ted_paper_analysis.Rmd file within code/analysis, which operates over the already wrangled data.

```
